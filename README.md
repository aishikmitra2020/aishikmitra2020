# 👋 Hey, I'm a high schooler (Class 10) who’s super into code and creativity.

💻 I’m currently learning **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, and actively building full-stack projects using the **MERN stack** and **python** —  
**MongoDB + Express.js + React.js + Node.js** 🔥

## 🛠️ Tech I've worked with:
- **Full-Stack**: **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Flask, Django (earlier)  
- **Databases**: MongoDB, MySQL  
- **Languages**: **Python (advanced)**, Java, C  
- **Others**: OpenCV (earlier), Git, Postman  
- 🧠 UpNext: **DSA with C++**, **Android Development**, **Generative AI**, **Devops**, **Cloud Computing**, **Networking**, **System Design**, **Java Full Stack**

## 🚀 Passionate About:
**Web Development** and **AI** — always building, breaking stuff, and learning along the way.

📚 Still in school (Class 10), not looking for work yet — just coding for the love of it.

⚡ *Building. Breaking. Learning. Repeating.*
